# 🔍 Wireshark Packet Capture Lab – Capturing HTTP Credentials Using a Fake Login Page

This project demonstrates how insecure **HTTP traffic** exposes sensitive information — including login credentials — when captured with Wireshark. I used **ChatGPT to generate a fake HTTP login page**, hosted it on **Kali Linux**, and captured the traffic on my **Windows machine** using Wireshark. This hands-on lab clearly shows the difference between HTTP (insecure) and HTTPS (encrypted).

## 🧪 1. Lab Environment

**Tools Used**
- **Windows 11** – running Wireshark (attacker/observer)
- **Kali Linux** – hosting the fake login page
- **ChatGPT** – generated the HTML login form
- **Python HTTP server** – to host the page on port 80 (HTTP)
- **VMware Workstation** – virtual network environment

**Objectives**
- Use ChatGPT to generate a fake login form  
- Host the login form on Kali using an HTTP server  
- Submit test credentials from Windows  
- Capture and extract clear-text credentials in Wireshark  
- Compare HTTP vs HTTPS traffic visibility  
- Understand why TLS is required

## 🤖 2. Using ChatGPT to Generate the Fake Login Page

I asked ChatGPT to generate a **simple HTML login page** that sends data using a POST request over HTTP. ChatGPT provided the following code:

### ✔ login.html (generated by ChatGPT)
```html
<form action="/login" method="POST" style="margin-top: 100px; font-family: Arial;">
  <h2>Login</h2>

  <label>Username:</label><br>
  <input type="text" name="username"><br><br>

  <label>Password:</label><br>
  <input type="password" name="password"><br><br>

  <button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

I saved this file on my Kali Linux machine as:

```
/home/kali/login.html
```

## 🖥️ 3. Hosting the Fake Login Page on Kali Linux

To make the page accessible, I used a simple Python HTTP server (no encryption).

### ✔ Starting the HTTP Server on Port 80
```
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

Then, from my Windows machine, I navigated to:

```
http://<KALI-IP>/login.html
```
<img width="1168" height="1273" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-01 112022" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13ca1552-f26e-4463-89c2-e7a4de820855" />

I entered fake credentials:
- Username: `Fake`
- Password: `Fakepassword`

These were sent **in plain text**, allowing Wireshark to capture them.

## 🌐 4. Capturing the Traffic in Wireshark

On Windows, I ran Wireshark and filtered only HTTP traffic.

### ✔ Wireshark Filter Used
```
http
```

Wireshark immediately displayed:
- The **HTTP POST request**
- The **form fields**
- The **username**
- The **password**
- The **URL path**

This is because **HTTP does not encrypt anything**.

## 🔐 6. HTTPS vs HTTP (What Wireshark Can See)

### **HTTP (Insecure)**
Wireshark can read:
- Username  
- Password  
- Full form data  
- URL paths  
- Cookies  
- All request details  

### **HTTPS (Secure with TLS)**
Wireshark only sees:
- IP addresses  
- TLS handshake  
- Encrypted traffic  

Wireshark **cannot** see:
- Username  
- Password  
- Form content  
- Query parameters  
- Page text  

TLS encrypts the entire HTTP payload.

## 🛡️ 7. What TLS Is (Simple Explanation)

TLS = **Transport Layer Security**  
It encrypts everything between client and server so attackers cannot read the data.

TLS protects:
- Login forms  
- Session cookies  
- Personal data  
- Website content  

Without TLS, all data is exposed.

## 🧠 9. Key Takeaways

- ChatGPT can quickly generate HTML login pages for safe testing  
- Hosting the page on Kali with Python makes it easy to simulate real attacks  
- HTTP sends **everything** in plain text  
- Wireshark can extract credentials instantly  
- HTTPS + TLS prevents credential exposure  
- This lab demonstrates real-world credential sniffing techniques

## 🎯 10. Skills Gained

- Using ChatGPT for rapid code generation  
- Building/testing insecure web pages  
- Packet capturing & filtering  
- Extracting credentials from network traffic  
- Understanding encryption and TLS  
- SOC analyst–level traffic analysis

## 🏁 11. Summary

This lab shows exactly why HTTP login pages are dangerous. By generating a fake login page with ChatGPT, hosting it on Kali Linux, and capturing the traffic with Wireshark on Windows, I was able to clearly see the username and password in plain text. This demonstrates the importance of TLS encryption and provides essential hands-on experience in network security and packet analysis.
